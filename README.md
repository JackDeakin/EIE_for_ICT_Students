# EIE_for_ICT_Students
Teaching and assessment research on entrepreneurship delivery to ICT students

We develop a couple of data crawling tool and analysis tools in studying EIE units for ICT students. The code for data crawling is data_crawl.py while the analysis tool is relevance.py.

The data_crawl.py collected 510 research papers in Google Scholar while the relevance.py figured out 293 of them for further analysis.

Then, we idenfied 9 out of 293 is relevant to our research question. The paper is currently under revision so the tools and data are not fully disclosed at this moment.
